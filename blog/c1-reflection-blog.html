      What's your take on the DBC / EDA experience?

      From my experience of phase-0 so far, i feel very well supported and informed. The ciriculum feels well put together and organic. Waffle board is great for keeping organised.
    </p>

      What are your impressions?

      My cohort and coaches all seem to be very motivated and kind. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
      How do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture?

      I see myself fitting in very well with the like minded and supportive people I have met so far. I can't wait to start pair programming with them, andreally looking forward to getting stuck into some long intense days at DBC in Welli.
    </p>
    
    <p> 
      Have your expectations of EDA changed? If so, how?

      I have reaslied that I am going to need to dedicate alot more time during the week to the phase-0 assignment and learning. There is not enough time to get it all done over the weekends. Pomodoro technique is going to be my new best friend I think.

    Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning environment? Does it make you nervous?

      Yes I am very excited about this learning environment. I have done the whole university thing, and I eventually learned what I needed to know, but it too way too long, and I feel that the EDA way of teaching and learning will be vastly more benificial for me. 
      Yes it does make me nervous, I am worried about quitting my job and going back to full-time study. However I feel that EDA will give me the best shot at getting into a new field that I have the potential to excel at, but mist importantly, enjoy myself
