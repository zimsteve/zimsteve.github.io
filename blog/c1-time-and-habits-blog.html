    <h4>Time and Habit Management</h4>
    
    <p>which timebox and habits techniques did you try?<br>
    I tried the pomodoro and 5 ways to De-clutter your mind and regain your focus</p>

    <p>what did you find interesting?<br>
    I found the technique of embracing the junk drawer very interesting. Using a digital notebook like OneNote or Evernote to store thoughts as they pop into your head, saving them for later, thus not letting them distract you from your current task within your pomodoro. Then going back and having a look at them</p>
    <p>what worked for you?<br>
    The pomodoro technique and using simple organisational tasks during my 5 minute breaks between pomodoros, really did lighten my mind, and help me feel like I was not neglecting day to day chores.</p>
    <p>which will you experiment further with?<br>
    I want to look futher into Zaiper and experiment eith it and other automation techiques</p>
